                <p>Over the coming weeks, the Parish Safeguarding Committee will provide key messages of safeguarding to promote the welfare of children, young people and adults.  This week we are focusing on domestic and sexual abuse.</p>
                <p>During this time of the COVID 19 pandemic we are all spending more time at home or in a domestic setting, which may at times create potentially stressful situations.</p>
                <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing abuse, do not suffer in silence.</p>
                <p>Call the 24 Hour Domestic and Sexual Abuse Helpline on <b>0808 802 1414</b> or email <a href="mailto:help@dsahelpline.org">help@dsahelpline.org</a></p>
                <p>Contact the police on 101 or in an emergency call 999.</p>
